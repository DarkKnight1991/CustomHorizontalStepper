# CustomHorizontalStepper

This project gives a sample code for developing horizontal stepper view. A view that shows step by step activity to user.
It also includes some cool animations while changing steps as shown in gif below :

The view is drawn dynamically based on the screen width and number of stpes (which can be configured using variable in program).
All calculations for calculating view dimensions are handled by the program.

Feel free to use it in your projects but kindly provide credit to the developer.
